 * (one file had a wrong Kaohsiung district), which is the class of bug
 * this file exists to prevent.
 *
 * Bug reference (2026-04-23): AI quoted wrong address "台北內湖" and wrong
 * price "98.9萬" (newCarPrice leakage) in live conversation. See
 * docs/PROJECT_JOURNAL.md for full incident details.
 *
 * WHEN YOU CHANGE ANY VALUE HERE: run `npm test -- factLock` and make
 * sure Jerry confirms the change matches reality.
